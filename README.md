# twotimepad-solver
A small interactive solver for an encrypted twotimepad. This tool is written in PHP.


## Usage

Just start the programm via PHP. I know it works with PHP8.2, but
probably also in 7.4, 8.0 and 8.1.

```shell
php decrypt.php ../examples/msg*.asc
```

or

```shell
php decrypt.php ./examples/msg1.asc ./examples/msg2.asc
```
